Lrexlib is a binding of five regular expression library APIs (POSIX,
PCRE, GNU, TRE and Oniguruma) to Lua 5.1.

Lrexlib is copyright Reuben Thomas 2000-2010 and copyright Shmuel
Zeigerman 2004-2010, and is released under the MIT license, like Lua
(see http://www.lua.org/copyright.html for the full license; it's
basically the same as the BSD license). There is no warranty.

Please report bugs and make suggestions to the maintainer, or use the
LuaForge trackers and mailing lists.

Thanks to Thatcher Ulrich for bug and warning fixes, and to Nick
Gammon for adding support for PCRE named subpatterns.
