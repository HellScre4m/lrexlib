To test Lrexlib, execute the following command line:

  lua ./runtest.lua [posix] [pcre] [-v]

Where:
  posix --> test rex_posix library
  pcre  --> test rex_pcre library
  -v    --> "verbose output"

Notes:
  * At least one library (posix or pcre) must be specified.
  * Order of arguments does not matter
